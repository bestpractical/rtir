=head1 Upgrading to 5.0

The following describes some of the key components of the upgrade
to RTIR 5.0 from earlier versions. The other UPGRADING documents contain
details for previous versions.

=head2 Notable Changes

=over

=item *

In RTIR 4.0, we modified the menu display to move each queue to a
top level menu item when working inside RTIR. Each menu ended up
having just a "Create" entry and we haven't found new menu items
to add for each queue. This change made it harder to access the
default RT menus, so we have reverted to the previous configuration
with a single RTIR menu item containing relevant links.

=item *

To align with RT's create pages we removed the modal to select queue
before the create page and now give users the option to select
queue directly on create. CreateInQueue.html still remains available
incase users are linking directly to it but now logs a deprecated
warning when accessed.

CreateInQueue.html will be removed in a future version of RTIR.
Please update any links directly accessing CreateInQueue.html to
instead link to RTIR/Create.html or RTIR/Incident/Create.html.

=item *

Previous versions of RTIR, set RT's DefaultQueue option to Incident Reports.
The new versions of RT and RTIR move the queue selection to the create page
from the top action, so a new RTIR_DefaultQueue option is now available to
set the default queue for RTIR create ticket pages.

With this new RTIR-specific option, RTIR no longer automatically sets RT's
DefaultQueue. You can still set it manually for your system via the RT
configuration.
