=head1 Upgrading to RTIR 5.0

The following describes some of the key components of the upgrade
to RTIR 5.0 from RTIR 4.0.  The other UPGRADING documents contain
details for previous versions.

As with other versions of RTIR, you first need to upgrade RT itself
to a supported version. For RTIR 5.0, this is RT 5.0.

Previous versions of RTIR, set RT's DefaultQueue option to Incident Reports.
The new versions of RT and RTIR move the queue selection to the create page
from the top menu, so a new RTIR_DefaultQueue option is now available to set
the default queue for RTIR create ticket pages.

With this new RTIR-specific option, RTIR no longer automatically sets RT's
DefaultQueue. You can still set it manually for your system via the RT
configuration.
