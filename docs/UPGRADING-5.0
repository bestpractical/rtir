In RTIR 4.0, we modified the menu display to move each queue to a
top level menu item when working inside RTIR. Each menu ended up
having just a "Create" entry and we haven't found new menu items
to add for each queue. This change made it harder to access the
default RT menus, so we have reverted to the previous configuration
with a single RTIR menu item containing relevant links.
