=head1 Upgrading to 5.0

The following describes some of the more significant changes
to RTIR 5.0 from earlier versions. The other UPGRADING documents contain
details for previous versions.

Also read the general L<UPGRADING> document for the steps to upgrade from
a previous version of RTIR.

To match up RT 5 versions, we escalated RTIR from 5.0.1 to 5.0.3 directly,
so there is no RTIR 5.0.2.

=head2 Notable Changes

=over

=item *

In RTIR 4.0, we modified the menu display to move each queue to a
top level menu item when working inside RTIR. Each menu ended up
having only a single "Create" entry and we haven't found new menu items
to add for each queue. This change made it harder to access the
default RT menus, so we have reverted to the previous configuration
with a single RTIR menu item containing relevant links.

To make it easier to access the RTIR menu, and to keep it in a
consistent location, we moved it to the left, directly after
the default RT Home menu.

=item *

To align with RT's create pages we removed the modal to select queue
before the create page and now give users the option to select
queue directly on create. CreateInQueue.html still remains available
in case users are linking directly to it but now logs a deprecated
warning when accessed.

CreateInQueue.html will be removed in a future version of RTIR.
Please update any links directly accessing CreateInQueue.html to
instead link to RTIR/Create.html or RTIR/Incident/Create.html.

=item *

Previous versions of RTIR set RT's DefaultQueue option to Incident Reports.
The new versions of RT and RTIR move the queue selection to the create page
from the top action, so a new RTIR_DefaultQueue option is now available to
set the default queue for RTIR create ticket pages.

With this new RTIR-specific option, RTIR no longer automatically sets RT's
DefaultQueue. You can still set it manually for your system via the RT
configuration.

=item *

The RTIR search page has been re-worked to use RT's base search features
more directly. This gives RTIR full access to current and future search
and reporting features added to RT.

We have retained the features associated with the custom RTIR search
interface including limiting queue selection to RTIR queues and providing
some additional RTIR menu options.

On the previous RTIR search, the Advanced and Bulk Update menu options were
hidden. Visibility of these two menus is now managed with a new right in
RT. The RT 5.0 upgrade process grants these rights to all Privileged users,
but you can revoke these rights to restore the previous RTIR menu.

=item *

On RTIR at a glance, the default configuration for Incident sections now
includes Priority. Priority is also now a second-level sort, so Incidents
will be ordered first by Due date (most Due first), then by Priority (highest
priority first).

RT 5.0 now defaults to managing priority with set values like "High" and "Low"
rather than numbers, so you will see that in RTIR also. See the RT upgrade
notes for details on how to set your Priority levels and for how to revert
to number-based priority if you prefer.

If you don't use Priority on Incidents, you can customize the search result
columns with the "DueIncidents" entry in the C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats>
configuration.

=item *

The Updates column in Incident ticket listings on RTIR at a glance now shows
the number of unread messages on the Incident ticket rather than just Yes/No.
As with Priority above, this setting can be customized with the "DueIncidents"
entry in C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats>. The previous option was called UpdateStatus
and the new version is UnreadMessages.

=item *

Default values for RTIR custom fields previously set using the configuration
option C<%RTIR_CustomFieldsDefaults> are now set using RT's core custom
field default value feature. If you had defaults previously set, they will
be migrated automatically during upgrade.

RT supports setting these defaults both in the custom field configuration,
which will set a default for all queues, and in the queue configuration
for each individual queue.

C<%RTIR_CustomFieldsDefaults> now sets default values only for "Resolution"
because the Resolution values are set based on the status of the
Incident when closed.

=item *

On Incidents, the linked tickets for Incident Reports, Investigations, and
Countermeasures are now controlled via the new
L<LinkedQueuePortlets|https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/5.0.0/RT_Config.html#LinkedQueuePortlets>
feature in RT. If you previously modified the format of the link display
on the Incidents page using C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats> for C<ChildReport>,
C<ChildInvestigation>, or C<ChildCountermeasure>, you can copy that configuration
to the new C<%LinkedQueuePortletFormats> option.

=item *

Before RTIR 4.0 you could launch an incident and investigation on a single page.
This feature was removed in RTIR 4.0, but has been restored in RTIR 5.0.0. It
has also been updated to allow the queue for each section to be selected on
the create page.

=item *

RTIR display pages now support inline edit, similar to the core RT feature.
The configuration option C<%InlineEditPanelBehavior>, as documented in
RT, allows you to set the edit behavior. To set different behavior for
RTIR, you can use the key C<RTIR::Ticket> with the same format as that
documented for C<RT::Ticket>.

=item * "RTIR at a glance" is now a dashboard

"RTIR at a glance" previously could be customized and was stored as
a special configuration used just for the RTIR homepage.
It is now a dashboard just like other dashboards in RT.
With this update, you can now easily change your entire RTIR homepage
by selecting a different dashboard to be your default homepage.
This update aligns with RT where a similar change was made in RT 5.0.2.

After upgrading, RTIR at a glance should look the same as it did
previously, but there are various changes in how it is managed.

The previous global RTIR at a glance page is converted to a new System
dashboard called "RTIR Homepage". Individual users with a custom homepage
will see a new dashboard in "My Dashboards" called "RTIR Homepage". These are
regular dashboards now, so the names can be changed if desired.

The gears icon on the RTIR homepage now links to a page that displays all
available dashboards and users can select their default homepage from
the list. To customize, users can create a new dashboard. The privacy
of dashboards can be set to an individual user, a group, or system-wide,
depending on the user's rights. This makes it easy to set up and share
useful RTIR homepage configurations.

Users who want to customize their homepage need the rights "ModifySelf",
"CreateOwnDashboard", "DeleteOwnDashboard", "ModifyOwnDashboard" and
"SeeOwnDashboard". All users who have "ModifySelf" are automatically granted
these dashboard rights as part of the RT 5.0.2 upgrade. You can modify
these rights as desired if you don't want users to be able to create dashboards.

All users can see the default System dashboard set for RTIR. If you
want to allow users to see other System dashboards, grant the
"SeeDashboard" right. This is not done automatically with the upgrade.

=item * Global "RTIR at a glance" configuration page

For RT admins, Admin > Global > RTIR at a glance is now available, and
instead of loading the page configuration editor, it shows a list of
System dashboards that can be set as the default homepage.

=item * RT's Default Article Content Custom Field is Deselected

When initially installing RT, a global custom field Content is created
and applied to Articles. RTIR also creates an Article custom field on
installation, called Response. The default DutyTeam group has rights to
use the Response CF, but not the Content CF and typically for boilerplate
email responses you need only one custom field. The extra CF can also cause
issues with automatically inserting content on the ticket reply page.

As part of this update, we deselect the Content CF from the Templates
class, which is the default for RTIR. This should make the Response CF
work as intended. If you are using the Content CF in some way, you
can edit the Templates class configuration and enable it again.

=item * CVE ID Custom Field Added

A new default custom field called C<CVE ID> is added with this upgrade.
On Incidents with a CVE defined, some information about the CVE from
the NIST vulnerability system is displayed on the page with a link
to the full description on the NIST website.

CVE IDs can also now be parsed and automatically added to this
custom field from incoming email, similar to IP addresses.

If you don't track CVEs with your RTIR instance, you can disable
the custom field and the new scrips.

=item * Run Transaction Batch last, even in nested updates

When RTIR processes scrips, Batch mode scrips should always run last.
Previously, with nested updates, inner updates would run batch before
all outer updates were complete. One example of this is processing ticket
updates, the Basics update calls an inner "atomic" transaction to update
Owner, which would cause the unexpected batch run. This has been fixed
so batch runs only once for the outermost updates. All transactions
performed for that batch are available from the C<TransactionBatch> method
as expected.

This mirrors a change also made in RT 5.0.2.

=item * Incident Reply Updates

On the Incident Reply to Reporters and Reply to All pages, "Worked" is now
in a new "Incident Time Taken" section to make it clear that you are recording time
worked on the incident, and to make it easy to do so. Previously there was a Worked
field in the Reply section, which would then apply time to all linked tickets.

The goal of the Reply to All pages is to send out a notification or update to
multiple people in one step, so the time you are reporting is usually on
the Incident ticket, not once per linked ticket. However, this is a change from the
previous behavior. This update allows for cleaner integration with
RT::Extension::TimeTracking, which provides additional time tracking features.

Processing of the update message was also moved before processing of other ticket
updates like Basics (status, etc.), custom fields, and dates. This makes RTIR more
consistent with RT, but it's possible this could impact scrips if the relied on
Basics or other updates running before message updates. If you have this issue,
moving the scrip to Batch mode may restore the previous behavior.

=item * Process Articles for Incidents

Starting with RTIR 5.0.4, we include a new portlet on the Incident page
which can show the process to be followed for an Incident based on the
selected Classification.

Default articles for the process documentation are installed in new RTIRs
by default. For an existing RTIR system, you can also add the starter
articles by running the following after your upgrade:

    cd /opt/rt5
    sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert --datafile local/plugins/RT-IR/etc/upgrade/process_articles_initialdata

=item * Allow DutyTeam to See Templates Articles

This upgrade runs a step to grant the default DutyTeam group rights to
see custom fields in the Templates class. This allows DutyTeam members
to use articles when corresponding on tickets. This right was previously
omitted in error.

If you explicitly do not want DutyTeam to see the articles in the Templates
class, you can edit the class and remove the SeeCustomField right after you
run the upgrade.
