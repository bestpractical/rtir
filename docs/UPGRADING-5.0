=head1 Upgrading to 5.0

The following describes some of the key components of the upgrade
to RTIR 5.0 from earlier versions. The other UPGRADING documents contain
details for previous versions.

=head2 Notable Changes

=over

=item *

In RTIR 4.0, we modified the menu display to move each queue to a
top level menu item when working inside RTIR. Each menu ended up
having just a "Create" entry and we haven't found new menu items
to add for each queue. This change made it harder to access the
default RT menus, so we have reverted to the previous configuration
with a single RTIR menu item containing relevant links.

=item *

To align with RT's create pages we removed the modal to select queue
before the create page and now give users the option to select
queue directly on create. CreateInQueue.html still remains available
incase users are linking directly to it but now logs a deprecated
warning when accessed.

CreateInQueue.html will be removed in a future version of RTIR.
Please update any links directly accessing CreateInQueue.html to
instead link to RTIR/Create.html or RTIR/Incident/Create.html.

=item *

Previous versions of RTIR set RT's DefaultQueue option to Incident Reports.
The new versions of RT and RTIR move the queue selection to the create page
from the top action, so a new RTIR_DefaultQueue option is now available to
set the default queue for RTIR create ticket pages.

With this new RTIR-specific option, RTIR no longer automatically sets RT's
DefaultQueue. You can still set it manually for your system via the RT
configuration.

=item *

The RTIR search page has been re-worked to use RT's base search features
more directly. This gives RTIR full access to current and future search
and reporting features added to RT.

We have retained the features associated with the custom RTIR search
interface including limiting queue selection to RTIR queues and providing
some additional RTIR menu options.

On the previous RTIR search, the Advanced and Bulk Update menu options were
hidden. Visibility of these two menus is now managed with a new right in
RT. The RT 5.0 upgrade process grants these rights to all Privileged users,
but you can revoke these rights to restore the previous RTIR menu.

=item *

On RTIR at a glance, the default configuration for Incident sections now
includes Priority. Priority is also now a second-level sort, so Incidents
will be ordered first by Due date (most Due first), then by Priority (highest
priority first).

RT 5.0 now defaults to managing priority with set values like "High" and "Low"
rather than numbers, so you will see that in RTIR also. See the RT upgrade
notes for details on how to set your Priority levels and for how to revert
to number-based priority if you prefer.

If you don't use Priority on Incidents, you can customize the search result
columns with the "DueIncidents" entry in the C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats>
configuration.
