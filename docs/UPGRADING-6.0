=head1 Upgrading to RTIR 6.0

The following describes some of the more significant changes
to RTIR 6.0 from earlier versions. The general L<UPGRADING> document
describes the steps to upgrade from a previous version of RTIR.

To align version numbers more clearly, the initial released version
of RTIR 6 is 6.0.1, which should be run with RT 6.0.1.

=head2 Notable Changes

=item *

The following default RTIR homepage elements have been converted
to RT saved searches and the previous mason templates have been
removed.

    html/RTIR/Elements/NewReports
    html/RTIR/Elements/UserDueIncidents
    html/RTIR/Elements/NobodyDueIncidents
    html/RTIR/Elements/DueIncidents

The new saved searches work the same as the previous components.

Previously you could customized the content of these components using the
C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats> option by setting custom formats for C<NewReports>
or C<DueIncidents> entries. You can now modify this format directly in
the web UI by editing the saved search.

=item *

As with core RT, saved searches, including the ones noted above, can now be
configured to refresh automatically. This new feature replaces the Refresh
component on the home page that refreshed the entire page.

See the RT 6 upgrading documentation for details on the update to refresh
features.

=item *

The Iframe option for adding research tools to the lookup pages in RTIR
previously configured with C<$RTIRIframeResearchToolConfig> has been removed.
Browsers are becoming much more restrictive when loading content in Iframes
and many websites are also adding code to block them from being loaded in
Iframes. In our testing, the default example configurations provided with
RTIR no longer worked and we didn't find other replacements that would
work by loading them in an Iframe.
