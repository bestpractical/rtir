=head1 Upgrading to RTIR 6.0

The following describes some of the more significant changes
to RTIR 6.0 from earlier versions. The general L<UPGRADING> document
describes the steps to upgrade from a previous version of RTIR.

To align version numbers more clearly, the initial released version
of RTIR 6 is 6.0.1, which should be run with RT 6.0.1.

=head2 Notable Changes

=over

=item *

The following default RTIR homepage elements have been converted
to RT saved searches and the previous mason templates have been
removed.

    html/RTIR/Elements/NewReports
    html/RTIR/Elements/UserDueIncidents
    html/RTIR/Elements/NobodyDueIncidents
    html/RTIR/Elements/DueIncidents

The new saved searches work the same as the previous components.

Previously you could customized the content of these components using the
C<%RTIRSearchResultFormats> option by setting custom formats for C<NewReports>
or C<DueIncidents> entries. You can now modify this format directly in
the web UI by editing the saved search.

=item *

As with core RT, saved searches, including the ones noted above, can now be
configured to refresh automatically. This new feature replaces the Refresh
component on the home page that refreshed the entire page.

See the RT 6 upgrading documentation for details on the update to refresh
features.

=item *

As RTIR has switched to RT 6's flexible page layout, a few RTIR-specific
configurations are updated:

In C<%CustomFieldGroupings> and C<%InlineEditPanelBehavior>, RTIR uses key
"RT::Ticket" just like RT, instead of previous "RTIR::Ticket".

=item *

The Iframe option for adding research tools to the lookup pages in RTIR
previously configured with C<$RTIRIframeResearchToolConfig> has been removed.
Browsers are becoming much more restrictive when loading content in Iframes
and many websites are also adding code to block them from being loaded in
Iframes. In our testing, the default example configurations provided with
RTIR no longer worked and we didn't find other replacements that would
work by loading them in an Iframe.

=head2 New Lookup Tools

RTIR 6 adds a few new default lookup tools for finding additional
information about incident data, like domains and IP addresses.

The active lookup tools can be managed with the C<@RTIRResearchTools>
configuration options. If you don't want some tools presented in
the interface, update this configuration in C<RT_SiteConfig.pm> and
remove them from the list.

=over

=item *

IPinfo.io provides a service that returns metadata for provided IP
addresses. They offer a base free plan and various other plans
that offer more information at higher levels.

To enable this lookup tool, create an account and token at IPinfo.io
and set C<$LookupIPinfoToken>.
