=head1 Multiple Constituency Functionality

In some cases, your incident response team may provide
services to multiple different "customers" or constituent
groups. For example, you my provide incident support for both
educational and government institutions.
You may have different contact mechanisms for members
of these groups including different email addresses for reporting
incidents. For a variety of reasons, it makes sense to identify and
separately track interactions with these individual constituencies,
particularly when handling incidents.

However, it also makes sense to use the same tools when
working on these separate sources of data. Depending on the
constituency, different users may wish to work on incidents within
different queues or have access to incident data held within different
queues. Members on the education response team may not have privileges
to see information on government incidents, so you need to be able to
assign user privileges depending on the constituency.

With some additional configuration, RTIR provides a flexible system
that supports setting up multiple constituencies with different
incident handling and access rules. These configurations all run
in a single RTIR instance with shared workflows and global
configuration that applies to all constituencies. This guide
will help you configure RTIR to manage multiple constituencies.

The implementation of the constituencies feature was updated
in RTIR 4.0 and is described here. If you were using this
functionality in previous versions, you can read about specific
changes in L<UPGRADING-4.0>.

=head2 Definitions

A constituency is defined by:

=over

=item  *

Its name, as defined in the RTIR Constituency custom field on the queue
configuration page.

=item  *

Its correspondence email address.

=item *

Its queues--typically a set with one each of Incident Reports,
Incidents, Investigations, and Countermeasures--each with the same
RTIR Constituency value defined.

=item *

Associated ACLs (rights and permissions for queues, tickets, etc.)

=back

A ticket is assigned a constituency in a few different ways:

=over

=item *

On a new incoming incident report, the constituency set
automatically based on the incoming email address
(the correspond address) and the associated queue in which it
creates tickets.

=item *

Any new incidents created from incident reports, or countermeasures and
investigations created from incidents, inherit the constituency
from the launching ticket.

=item *

You can manually select the constituency to any new tickets created
in the RTIR web interface by selecting the RTIR queue associated
with a given constituency.

=item *

You can manually change the constituency of an incident and all its
related tickets by moving it to a new queue.

=back

Of course the last two points require that the user has the right to do so,
according to the ACLs.

=head1 Implementation Details

=head2 RTIR Constituency Custom Field

RTIR Constituency is a queue-level custom field, so the queue a ticket is in
determines the constituency. Constituencies is an optional feature of RTIR
so you can choose to leave it unset.

=head2 Constituency Values

Constituency is a custom field that applies to all RTIR queues. The RTIR
administrator can manage the field and its values via the RT web interface at
Tools -> Configuration -> Custom Fields -> click on the "RTIR Constituency"
custom field. At the bottom of the page in the Values section, you can add,
delete, and rename values, and change the sort order.

However, to get advanced control over constituencies you have to create additional
objects in the system. The steps below describe how to do this manually. A
script (F<bin/add_constituency>) is also provided which helps add new constituency
values, along with their associated groups and queues. In previous versions of RTIR,
these queues were a hidden implementation detail. In RTIR 4.0, each constituency has
its own queues, which work like regular RT queues.

=head2 Manually Managing Constituency Values

In some simple configurations, administrators may use the web interface
to add, delete, or rename values for the 'RTIR Constituency' field, however
if you need the advanced access control RTIR's Constituencies system
provides, you need to create several queues and groups for each
value.

For example the following objects affect the rights users can have to
the constituency 'EDUNET':

=over

=item * Queue 'Incident Reports - EDUNET'

=item * Queue 'Incidents - EDUNET'

=item * Queue 'Inestigations - EDUNET'

=item * Queue 'Countermeasures - EDUNET'

=item * Group 'DutyTeam EDUNET'

=item * Group 'ReadOnly EDUNET'

=back

See L</"Access Control (ACLs)"> below for more about granting rights using
special queues and groups.

=head2 Automatically Creating Constituencies

To make it easier to create all of the objects in RT needed for a
constituency, we have provided a tool to help. The tool can create
everything needed for a new constituency configuration, including groups
with some default permissions. It can also rename existing queues. You
can read the docmentation for the tool online at L<add_constituency> or
on your system. To run the tool, navigate to your base RT directory and
run it as follows:

    cd /opt/rt5    # Default location, yours may be different
    local/plugins/RT-IR/bin/add_constituency --help  # View docs
    local/plugins/RT-IR/bin/add_constituency --name EDUNET --correspond 'edunet@example.com'

After you run the tool, you can look at the permissions granted for the
groups created and modify them as needed.

=head2 Constituency Propagation

Starting in RTIR 4.0, the C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> option replaces the old C<$_RTIR_Constituency_Propagation> configuration option.

C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is a simple boolean which implements the most common behaviors of C<$_RTIR_Constituency_Propagation>.

If C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is set to 1, any attempt to link RTIR tickets across constituencies will result in an error. 

If C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is set to 0, RTIR will allow users to link tickets across multiple constituencies.

=head3 Introduction

Before discussing constituency propagation in depth let's look at
the primary ways of setting and changing the Constituency field.

=over

=item Creating a new ticket without links

This is the simplest case. A user creates a new ticket and there
is no reference to an existing ticket. For example, the user creates
an IR using the web UI by clicking RTIR -> Incident Reports ->
Create, fills in values, and leaves the Incident input blank. In
this case, the user will be able to create the ticket in any 
Incident Report queue for which they have the 'SeeQueue' and 
'CreateTicket' permissions.

=item Creating a new ticket with a link

RTIR allows users to create new tickets and link them with another
as a single step. For example a user can create a new IR from an Incident
or launch an Investigation from it. When a ticket is created based on an
existing ticket, we can use the core information from the existing ticket,
including the constituency value. 

If C<RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is set to 1, the list of available
queues for the new ticket will be limited to the Constituency of the source
ticket.

=item Creating a new ticket with Incident Id

This case is similar to the first case, but the user provides
an Incident Id in the Incident field. Since the new ticket references
and existing ticket, constituency logic can come into play as
noted in the second case.

=item Updating an existing ticket

Users can edit an existing ticket and change its constituency
by moving it to a new queue on the 'Advanced' tab.

If RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking is set to 1, and the ticket's new
queue is in a different constituency, all linked
tickets will be moved to the new queue's constituency.

=back

=head3 Advanced Linking

The Advanced tab allows you to do things that generic RTIR
interfaces don't, so you can merge arbitrary tickets, move tickets between
queues and, most important for constituencies, it
allows you to link tickets with different constituencies even if
C<RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is set to 1.

Permissions (ACLs) are still applied to such operations, but administrators
should note that by default links don't require bi-directional ACL checking.
This means a user does not need the ModifyTicket right on the ticket they
are linking to in order to set up a link. This behavior can be changed using
the C<$StrictLinkACL> option in RT's configuration.

=head2 Outgoing Mail: "CorrespondAddress" and "CommentAddress"

Each constituency has its own queues in RTIR. As such, 
C<CorrespondAddress> and C<CommentAddress> work just like they do 
for any RT queue.

For example, if a user replies to an IR with constituency EDUNET and RTIR
sends notifications, the correspond address of the 'Incident Reports - EDUNET'
queue is used in notifications, if one is set. If the field
is empty, the fallback address is the C<$CorrespondAddress>
in the RT's configuration file.

It is important to note that these additional configurations do not also
add new mail routing rules.  It is your responsibility to configure
C</etc/aliases>, C<rt-mailgate> and other parts of your email infrastructure
to handle mail coming to the constituency correspond addresses.

=head2 Access Control (ACLs)

RTIR allows you to grant additional rights to tickets based on their
constituency by means of "pseudo" queues ("Incidents - EDUNET" for
the EDUNET constituency on the Incidents queue, for example).

For example, assume you have two constituencies "EDUNET" and "GOVNET".
Your RTIR instance consists of four queues for each constituency: Incident Reports - EDUNET,
Incidents - EDUNET, Investigations - EDUNET and Countermeasures - EDUNET. To grant the user Edward
the right to work with EDUNET Incident Reports, make Edward an
AdminCc of the new queue, either directly or as a member of a group
like "DutyTeam EDUNET".
