=head1 Upgrading to 4.0

The following describes some of the key components of the upgrade
to RTIR 4.0 from RTIR 3.2.  The other UPGRADING documents contain
details for previous versions.

=head2 Web interface

=head3 Menus

When working inside RTIR, RT's menus are moved under the C<RT>
heading and RTIR's menus are expanded. We'd greatly appreciate your
suggestions for filling out RTIR's menus with additional useful functionality.

=head3 Incidents and Investigations

It is no longer possible to launch an investigation on the incident creation
page. Users will find the 'Launch Investigation' menu item missing when
creating an incident. This removal is a result of the flexibility granted by
the constituency rewrite in RTIR 4.0.

=head3 MaxInlineBody

The default value for the $MaxInlineBody config has changed from 0 (meaning
unlimited) to 25kb. You may wish to adjust this if you were relying on
RTIR's default.

=head2 Queues

It is now possible to have multiple incident report, incident,
investigation and countermeasure queues in RTIR. RTIR uses a queue's
lifecycle to determine what kind of queue it is, rather than its
name. This functionality is very much in its infancy and we welcome
your feedback.

=head2 Countermeasures

The Blocks queue was renamed to Countermeasures to indicate it is more
generic than just network blocks. The normal RTIR upgrade process
handles most of the renaming process, but you may need to adjust some of
your configuration and customizations.

The "blocks" lifecycle has been renamed to "countermeasures". If you
copied the RTIR lifecycle config, regardless of whether you customized
it, you'll need to rename the "blocks" lifecycle to "countermeasures" in
your config.

If you use RT_Config option RTIR_DisableBlocksQueue, please update your
config to instead set that option by its new name:
RTIR_DisableCountermeasures.

Similarly if you use RT_Config option RTIR_BlockAproveActionRegexp,
please update its name to RTIR_CountermeasureApproveActionRegexp (beware
the typo fix in the word "Approve").

If you set the RTIR_IncidentChildren config option, you'll need to
adjust the key "Block" to "Countermeasure" (note: not "Countermeasures").

If you have any custom code that deals with Blocks queues by name,
you'll need to update it.

=head2 Constituencies

=head3 Changes to constituencies

RTIR 4.0 features a major overhaul of the constituency system. The
standard upgrade procedure should migrate old constituencies to the
new system.

The new constituency system replaces the ticket-level 'Constituency'
custom field with a queue-level 'RTIR Constituency' custom field.
Each RTIR constituency now consists of four or more RT queues.
Tickets associated with a given consituency will be placed in
consistency-specific queues, rather than in the generic RTIR queues.
This has the advantage of being much faster, much simpler and much
easier to understand. In essence, we've replaced an older hack with
a standard RT feature.

What makes an RTIR queue an RTIR queue is now that its lifecycle
is set to one of the four RTIR lifecycles: 'investigations','
incident_reports', 'incidents' and 'countermeasures'. If it has a
value for the 'RTIR Constituency' custom field, it will also be
associated with that constituency.

Unlike earlier releases of RTIR, ACLS, Scrips, Custom Fields and
queue configuration for constituency-specific queues is now drawn
explicitly from those queues.

=head3 Web interface

If a user has permissions to work with multiple constituencies, it is
now possible to limit RTIR's web interface to a single constituency
by clicking a link from the B<Work with constituency> box on the RTIR
homepage. They can also go directly to C</RTIR/c/ConstituencyName>.

=head3 Ticket linking

The C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> option replaces the old
C<$_RTIR_Constituency_Propagation> configuration option.
C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is a simple boolean which implements the
most common behaviors of C<$_RTIR_Constituency_Propagation>.

If C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is set to 1, any attempt to link RTIR
tickets across constituencies will result in an error.

If C<$RTIR_StrictConstituencyLinking> is set to 0, RTIR will allow users to
link tickets across multiple constituencies.

=head3 Setting constituency based on email headers

RTIR 3.2 allowed sites to set ticket constituencies based on
the C<X-RT-Mail-Extension> message header. As RTIR now supports
the features of 'regular' RT queues for constituencies, using
message headers to set RTIR constituencies is no longer available.

=head2 Rights

=head3 ForwardMessage

DutyTeams now have the C<ForwardMessage> right by default.

=head2 SLAs

RT 4.4 cored L<RT::Extension::SLA>. If you have existing scrips that
manage Due or SLA on Incidents from previous versions of RTIR, you should
disable them in favor of the core RT SLA features. If the older scrips are
enabled, you will encounter a race condition between the core SLA and the RTIR
scrips that synchronize due dates between an incident and its most due active
child.
