RT for Incident Response is an open source, industrial-grade
incident-handling tool designed to provide a simple, effective
workflow for members of CERT and CSIRT teams. It allows team members
to track, respond to and deal with reported incidents and features a
number of tools to make common operations quick and easy.  RTIR is
built on top of RT, which is also available for free from Best
Practical Solutions at http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/.

RT and RTIR are commercially-supported software. To purchase support,
training, custom development, or professional services, please get in
touch with us at <sales@bestpractical.com>.


REQUIRED PACKAGES:
------------------

o   RT 4.4.0 or newer releases of the 4.4 series.
o   Net::Whois::RIPE 1.31 is bundled with RTIR for compatibility with the
    API RTIR uses and for a fix to run without warnings under perl 5.18.

Upgrade instructions:
-----------------------

If you've installed a prior version of RTIR, you will need to follow
special steps to upgrade.  See the docs/UPGRADING file for detailed
information.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

1) Install the current release of the RT 4.4 series following RT's
   regular installation instructions

2) Run "perl Makefile.PL" to generate a makefile for RTIR.

3) Install any extra Perl modules RTIR needs that aren't already
   installed. The output from the previous step will list new
   modules needed, or if existing modules need to be upgraded to a
   newer version.

4) Type "make install".

5) Activate the RTIR extension in the RT_SiteConfig.pm file:

    Plugin('RT::IR');

6a) If you are installing RTIR for the first time, initialize the RTIR
    database by typing "make initdb".

    WARNING: Do not attempt to re-initialize the database if you are
    upgrading.

6b) If you are UPGRADING from a previous installation, read the
    UPGRADING file for instructions on how to upgrade your
    database.

7) Stop and start your web server.


Configuring RTIR
----------------

1) Using RT's configuration interface, add the email address
   of the Network Operations Team (the people who will handle
   activating and removing Blocks) as AdminCc on the Blocks queue.
   RT -> Queues -> Blocks -> Watchers

2) You may want to modify the email messages that are automatically
   sent on the creation of Investigations and Blocks.
   RT -> Queues -> <Select RTIR's Queue> -> Templates.
   RT -> Global -> Templates.

3) By default, RT ships with a number of global Scrips.  You should use 
   RT's configuration interface to look through them, and disable any 
   that aren't apropriate in your environment.
   RT -> Queues -> <Select RTIR's Queue> -> Scrips.
   RT -> Global -> Scrips.

4) Add staff members who handle incidents to the DutyTeam group.
   RT -> Configuration -> Groups -> DutyTeam -> Members.

5) You can override values defined in RTIR_Config.pm by creating
   RTIR_SiteConfig.pm in /opt/rt4/etc/ and adding your customizations.


SETTING UP THE MAIL GATEWAY
---------------------------

An alias for the Incident Reports queue will need to be configured.
Add the following lines to /etc/aliases (or your local equivalent):

rtir:         "|/opt/rt4/bin/rt-mailgate --queue 'Incident Reports' --action correspond --url http://rt.example.com/"

You should substitute the URL for RT's web interface for http://rt.example.com/.

o  If your webserver uses SSL, rt-mailgate will require several new
   Perl libraries. See the RT README for more details on this option.

o  See "perldoc /opt/rt4/bin/rt-mailgate" for more info about the rt-mailgate
   script.

o  If you're configuring RTIR with support for multiple constituencies, please
   refer to the instructions in the file docs/Constituencies.pod which is also
   viewable here http://www.bestpractical.com/docs/rtir/3.4/Constituencies.html

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

If you would like to run RTIR's tests, you need to set a few environment
variables:

RT_DBA_USER - a user who can create a database on your RDBMS
              (such as root on mysql)

RT_DBA_PASSWORD - the password for RT_DBA_USER

To run tests:

$ RTHOME=/opt/my-rt perl Makefile.PL
$ RT_DBA_USER=user RT_DBA_PASSWORD=password make test

These are intended to be run before installing RTIR.

Like RT, RTIR expects to be able to create a new database called rt4test
on your system
