=head1 NAME

RT::Action::RTIR_SetCountermeasureStatus - sets status of the countermeasure according to a few rules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If transaction is inbound and status is pending then
change it to corresponding not pending status. This
rule can be protected with C<$RTIR_CountermeasureApproveActionRegexp>
option. Content of the transaction should match the regexp
if it's defined. Statuses are hardcoded and can not be
changed or this will not work properly.

If countermeasure is in an inactive status (by default 'removed')
then status changed to first possible active status
for countermeasures's lifecycle (by default 'active').

In all other cases status left unchanged.

=head2 Commit
